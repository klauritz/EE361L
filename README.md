# EE361L - Section 3
Informational Repository for University of Hawaii at Manoa's EE361L class. Specified for Section 3 of the Fall 2018 semester.

---

Hello, Section 3. I'll be putting guides and points of interests in the repository. If you're having trouble on certain aspects of System Verilog, this is a good place to look. Most of this information is filtered from the book. If you're still having trouble with topics discussed in this repository, I strongly recommend emailing me, the other two TAs, or Dr. Sasaki for help :)

Some things I plan on covering in the repository is:
 * Assign and always_comb statements in System Verilog
 * Named port configuration vs. Ordered port configuration
 * Case and casez statements in System Verilog

Stay tuned for more content.
